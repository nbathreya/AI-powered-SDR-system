```python
system_prompt = """You are an expert sales qualification analyst.
Assess leads based on:
- Company size and growth potential
- Decision-maker access (job title)
- Industry fit and relevance
- Engagement signals

Provide:
- Numerical score (0-100)
- Clear reasoning
- Actionable insights
"""

# Stage-specific context added for accuracy
```

#### Message Generation Prompts
```python
# Stage contexts prevent generic messaging:
stage_contexts = {
    "new": "First contact, make great impression",
    "contacted": "Acknowledge prior communication",
    "meeting": "Reference meetings, build momentum",
    "negotiation": "Focus on ROI, pricing, closing - NOT product intro",
    "closed_won": "Customer success, relationship building",
    "closed_lost": "Keep door open, non-pushy"
}

# Critical instruction:
"Make sure message reflects where lead is in sales process.
If negotiation stage, don't introduce product - they know it.
Focus on closing, ROI, addressing concerns."
```

### Comprehensive Response Validation

#### 1. Error Handling
- API timeout handling (30s default)
- Network error recovery
- Malformed response detection
- Fallback message system

#### 2. Response Validation
```python
# Required fields validated:

**Test Case Categories:**
```python
test_cases = {
    "high_value": {
        # C-level at Fortune 500 tech companies
        "expected": 85-100,
        "focus": "Proper weight to seniority and company size"
    },
    "low_value": {
        # Junior roles at small companies
        "expected": 0-30,
        "focus": "Appropriate low scoring"
    },
    "edge_cases": {
        # Missing data, unclear fit
        "expected": "Reasonable handling",
        "focus": "Graceful degradation"
    },
    "consistency": {
        # Same lead scored multiple times
        "expected": "¬±5 points variance",
        "focus": "Scoring stability"
    }
}
```

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Score distribution across leads
- Reasoning quality and clarity
- Scoring time (API performance)

- Auto-qualification accuracy

##### Message Generation Evaluation Tests

**Test Scenarios:**
```python
scenarios = {
    "stage_awareness": [
        ("new", "initial_outreach", "Should introduce company"),
        ("negotiation", "value_proposition", "Should focus on ROI, not intro"),
        ("closed_lost", "follow_up", "Should be non-pushy")
    ],
    "personalization": [
        ("complete_data", "High personalization expected"),
        ("minimal_data", "Generic but professional expected")
    ],
    "tone_appropriateness": [
        ("initial_outreach", "Professional and friendly"),
        ("negotiation", "Consultative and direct")
    ]
}
```

**Quality Criteria:**
- Personalization accuracy (uses company, title correctly)
- Tone matches stage and message type

- SMB (<100): Lower scores but not excluded
- Considers growth stage, funding, market presence
```

**2. Job Title Relevance (Weight: User-Defined)**
```python
Decision-Maker Tiers:
- C-Suite (CEO, CTO, CFO): 90-100 points
- VP/Director: 70-90 points
- Manager/Team Lead: 50-70 points
- Individual Contributor: 20-50 points
- Considers: Decision authority, budget control, influence
```

**3. Industry Relevance (Weight: User-Defined)**
```python
Industry Fit Assessment:
- Target industries (SaaS, Tech, etc.): High scores
- Adjacent industries: Moderate scores
- Non-target industries: Lower scores
- Factors: Market trends, typical budget, pain points
```

**4. Engagement Level (Weight: User-Defined)**
```python
Engagement Signals:
- Notes indicate pain points: +15 points
- Previous positive interactions: +20 points
- Proactive inquiry: +25 points
- Cold outreach: Baseline
```

#### User-Defined Scoring Criteria

**How It Works:**

   - Click "‚öôÔ∏è Scoring Settings" button
   - Modern modal opens with sliders

2. **Adjust Importance Weights**
   - Four sliders with number inputs
   - Range: 0-100% for each factor
   - Real-time validation (must total 100%)
   - Visual feedback on total

3. **Apply New Criteria**
   - Click "Save Settings"
   - Re-score all leads with new weights
   - Instant UI updates

**Use Case Examples:**

```python
# Enterprise-focused sales team:
scoring_criteria = {
    "company_size_weight": 0.50,      # 50%
    "job_title_weight": 0.25,         # 25%
    "industry_relevance_weight": 0.15, # 15%
    "engagement_weight": 0.10          # 10%
}

# Vertical SaaS (industry-specific):
scoring_criteria = {
    "company_size_weight": 0.15,
    "job_title_weight": 0.25,
    "industry_relevance_weight": 0.50,  # 50% - most important!
    "engagement_weight": 0.10
}

# Inbound lead qualification:
scoring_criteria = {
    "company_size_weight": 0.20,
    "job_title_weight": 0.20,
    "industry_relevance_weight": 0.20,
    "engagement_weight": 0.40  # 40% - engagement signals matter most
}
```

## üí¨ Personalized Messaging

### Context-Aware Message Generation

The system's most powerful feature: messages that intelligently adapt to where the lead is in the sales journey.

#### Pipeline Stage Intelligence

**How It Works:**
1. System checks lead's `pipeline_stage`
2. Loads stage-specific context for Grok
3. Grok generates message appropriate for relationship status
4. User gets contextually perfect message

**Stage Context Examples:**

**New/Qualified Stage:**
```python
Context: "First contact - make great impression"

Generated Message Example:
---
Subject: Quick question for Acme Corp, John

Hi John,

I noticed you're VP of Sales at Acme Corp. Companies in the technology
industry often struggle with lengthy sales cycles and manual lead qualification.

Our AI-powered platform has helped similar companies reduce qualification
time by 70% while increasing conversion rates. I'd love to share how we
specifically helped a company similar to yours achieve these results.

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
---
```

**Contacted Stage:**
```python
Context: "Acknowledge prior communication, move forward"

Generated Message Example:
---
Subject: Following up - Acme Corp

Hi John,

I wanted to follow up on my previous message about helping Acme Corp
streamline your sales process.

I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. Based on what I know
about your role and Acme's growth trajectory, I think there's real value
in exploring how we've helped similar VPs of Sales cut qualification
time in half.

Would a quick 10-minute call make sense?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
[Your Name]
---
```

**Negotiation Stage:**
```python
Context: "They know the product - focus on ROI, closing, addressing concerns"

Generated Message Example:
---
Subject: Implementation timeline & ROI breakdown

Hi John,

Following up on our discussion about Acme Corp's implementation needs.

Based on your team size (12 SDRs) and current qualification rate, here's
a realistic ROI projection:

- Month 1-2: Onboarding and integration ($0 productivity gain)
- Month 3-6: Ramp up (20-30% efficiency increase)
- Month 6+: Full adoption (65-75% time savings on qualification)

For your specific case, this translates to approximately 8 hours/week
saved per SDR, allowing them to focus on high-value conversations rather
than initial screening.

Regarding your question about data migration from Salesforce - that's
a standard 2-week process on our end with zero downtime for your team.

Happy to jump on a call this week to finalize details and address any
remaining questions.

Best,
[Your Name]
---

Note: No product introduction! They're negotiating - they know what it is.
Focus is on implementation details, ROI, and closing.

   - "Change tone to be more urgent"
   - "Include a reference to their recent funding round"
   ```

3. **AI Revises Message**
   ```python
   Grok receives:
   - Original message
   - User's instructions
   - Lead context
   
   Grok maintains:
   - Core value proposition
   - Personalization elements
   - Professional quality
   
   Grok adjusts:

### Search & Metadata System

#### Full-Text Search Implementation

**Frontend Client-Side Search:**
```javascript
Search Fields:
- first_name
- last_name
- email
- company
- job_title
- industry
- notes

Logic:
- Case-insensitive (toLowerCase())
- Partial matching (includes())
- Real-time filtering
- Combined with other filters (AND logic)

Performance:
- Instant results (no API call)
- Efficient array filtering
- Scales to thousands of leads
- No database load
```

**Advanced Filters:**
```javascript
Available Filters:
1. Company (text search, partial match)
2. Industry (text search, partial match)
3. Date Range (created_at between from/to)
4. Score Range (score between min/max)

All Filters Combine:
filtered = leads
  .filter(search query match)
  .filter(company match)
  .filter(industry match)
  .filter(date range)
  .filter(score range)
  .filter(stage filter if active)
```

#### Metadata Organization

**Lead Metadata Structure:**
```python
Basic Information:
- Name: first_name, last_name
- Contact: email, phone

Company Data:
- Company name, size, location
- Website, LinkedIn URL
- Industry classification

Professional Context:
- Job title (decision-maker level)
- Role description (in notes)
- Seniority indicators

Scoring & Assessment:
- Numerical score (0-100)
- AI-generated reasoning
- Score timestamp (via updated_at)

Pipeline Context:
- Current stage
- Stage history (via activities)
- Notes (manual context)

Audit Metadata:
- created_at (when lead added)
- updated_at (last modification)
- deleted_at (if soft-deleted)
- deleted_by (who deleted)
```

**Message Metadata:**
```python
Message Context:
- Type (initial_outreach, follow_up, etc.)
- Subject line
- Full content
- Created timestamp
- Sent timestamp (future: email integration)
- Link to lead (foreign key)

Version Control:
- Original message: "initial_outreach"
- Tuned version: "initial_outreach_tuned"
- Linked via lead_id and created_at proximity
```

**Activity Metadata:**
```python
Event Tracking:
- Type (lead_created, lead_scored, message_generated, etc.)
- Description (human-readable summary)
- Notes (detailed context, AI reasoning, etc.)
- Timestamp (precise event time)
- Link to lead

Audit Capability:
- Complete event log
- Chronological order
- Immutable (append-only)
- Searchable and filterable
```

### Data Validation Framework

**Input Validation (Pydantic Schemas):**
```python
# backend/app/schemas.py

class LeadCreate(BaseModel):
    # Required
    first_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    last_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    email: EmailStr  # Pydantic email validation
    
    # Optional
    phone: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=20)
    company: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=200)
    job_title: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=100)
    industry: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=100)
    company_size: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=50)
    location: Optional[str] = Field(None, max_length=200)
    website: Optional[HttpUrl] = None  # URL validation
    linkedin_url: Optional[HttpUrl] = None
    notes: Optional[str] = None

class LeadUpdate(BaseModel):
    # All fields optional for partial updates
    first_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, min_length=1)
    last_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, min_length=1)
    email: Optional[EmailStr] = None
    # ... other fields
```

**Business Logic Validation:**
```python
Unique Constraints:
- Email must be unique across all leads
- Check on create and update

Referential Integrity:
- Foreign keys enforced (messages ‚Üí leads, activities ‚Üí leads)
- Cascade delete configured

State Validation:
- Can't restore non-deleted lead (check is_deleted)
- Can't delete already-deleted lead
- Pipeline stage must be valid enum value

Score Validation:
- Score range: 0.0 to 100.0
- Auto-qualify logic: >= 80 ‚Üí qualified stage
- Reasoning required when score set
```

**Error Handling Strategy:**
```python
HTTP Status Codes:
- 200 OK: Successful operation
- 201 Created: Lead created successfully
- 400 Bad Request: Malformed request
- 404 Not Found: Lead doesn't exist
- 409 Conflict: Duplicate email, state conflict
- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation error
- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected error

User-Friendly Messages:
‚úì Good: "A lead with email 'john@example.com' already exists."
‚úó Bad: "IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: leads.email"

Error Response Format:
{
  "detail": "User-friendly error message"
}
```

**Transaction Management:**
```python
Database Transactions:
- All operations wrapped in transactions
- Rollback on any error
- Ensures data consistency

Example:
try:
    db_lead = create_lead(...)
    db.add(db_lead)
    activity = log_activity(...)
    db.add(activity)
    db.commit()  # Atomic: all or nothing
except Exception as e:
    db.rollback()  # Undo all changes
    raise HTTPException(...)
```
